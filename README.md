# Data Visualisation to help a retail investor with stock analysis

## Introduction
No matter how much or how little experience you have in a given niche, investing can be complicated. Youâ€™ll often be dealing with hundreds of variables, thousands of possible decisions, and a cluster of holdings in your portfolio at any given time. Financial analysis such as technical and fundamental analyses can be overwhelming for a retail investor. The goal of this project is to help a retail investor to digest technical and fundamental data for stock selection by using data visualization. The series of visualizations below will provide information about these analyses and explanations for them, aiming to simplify the process by making the data easily interpretable.

The data contains multiple files, and contains information such as fundamentals data, securities, and daily historical prices dating from the beginning of January 2010 to the end of December 2016.
